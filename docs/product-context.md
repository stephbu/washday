- Add and label grant dates and dividend dates
- Visualize windows where wash-sale rules apply or do not apply

## MVP Scope

## Constraints

- Data sources to be determined

## Rules And Assumptions
- U.S. wash-sale rules are the initial target unless otherwise specified
- Grants and dividends are modeled as user-entered events used to compute risk windows
- The product provides informational visualization only, not tax advice

## Open Questions
